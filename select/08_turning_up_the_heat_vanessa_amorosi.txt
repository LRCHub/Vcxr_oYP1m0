Turning up the heat, yeah
Always turning up the heat

Love wasn't meant to be
Easy without a care
And this love will be hard to keep
From a distance without turning cold

Tell me what you think about us
Tell me how you're feeling when you're lost
Always sitting down
But with you I've always found I was free

If it's up to you I want it up to me
Our fightings always been, so good
And always turning up the heat

If it's up to you I want it up to me
Our fightings always been, so good
And always turning up the heat

Time had never been a loss
The same with the days that never end
And life could never seem to stop
Unless you fail to be there once again, once again

Tell me what you think about us
Tell me how you're feeling when you're lost
Always sitting down
But with you I've always found I was free

If it's up to you I want it up to me
Our fightings always been, so good
And always turning up the heat

If it's up to you I want it up to me
Our fightings always been, so good
And always turning up the heat

You have got the keys to my front door
We share each others life and more
But when you get yourself mad and go to leave
I don't try to make things easy

I said put your bags on the ground
Sit back down on the couch
This is love we will work it out
Fighting is what we're all about

Turn up and turn up
And turn up the heat

If it's up to you I want it up to me
Our fightings always been, so good
And always turning up the heat

If it's up to you I want it up to me
Our fightings always been, so good
And always turning up the heat

If it's up to you I want it up to me
Our fightings always been, so good
And always turning up the heat

If it's up to you I want it up to me
Our fightings always been, so good
And always turning up the heat
