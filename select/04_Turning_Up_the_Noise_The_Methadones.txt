Turing up the noise/ turning up the noise
I've got my finger's in my ears-turning up the noise

You love hearing the sound of your voice when you speak
I'm really not impressed with your tirade of the week
Is there a point you're trying to make?
Won't you stop for heavens sake
Because you're really fucking killing me
[Chorus]
You think everything you touch turns to gold
Just wait when you wake up feeling old
Listen to yourself for a minute and you might see
You're really insecure pretending to know everything
[Chorus]
