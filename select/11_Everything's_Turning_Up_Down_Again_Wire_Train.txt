She said you had some pain to share
Her lost direction darkness dear
Surrounds her dreams
Surrounds her prayers
Surrounds her mouth
And all her dreams

Everytings turning up down again
Everytings turning up down
Again

Her life's a game of friends of layer
You know in every word she says
Theses mornings rise into her face
Like masks to hide another day

Everytings turning up down again
Everytings turning up down
Again

You can't stand by me 'cause
I don't care
You must be dreaminf and
You're not even here

Everytings turning up down again
Everytings turning up down again
Everytings turning up down again
Everything is
Everything is

Everything is
Everything is
Everytings turning up down again
Everytings turning up down again
Everytings turning up down again
